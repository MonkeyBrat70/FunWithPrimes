# FunWithPrimes
Python Module for Exploration of Prime Numbers

This module is intended for learning purposes.  It may or may not be the mose efficient way to sequentially identify prime numbers, but it has helped me get started at learning Python programming.  Feedback of any kind is welcome.

The program stores any prime numbers it identifies in  the file Primes. If this file  does not exist, it will create it with the prime number 2 in it.

I have included on GitHub a file called PrimesUnder20M.  This is a file that I generated with FunWithPrimes.py which includes all prime numbers less than 20,000,000.  If you want to use those numbers in FunWithPrimes, simply rename your old Primes file (unless you don't care to lose it) and rename PrimesUnder20M to Primes.
